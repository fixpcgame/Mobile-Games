## Probabilistic rewarded-ad system, leveraging player anticipation and balancing reward value to preserve progression pacing without forced pop-ups

In the game, tapping falling presents opens a pop-up that gives players a 30% chance of a big reward instantly - something that would normally take minutes to earn.

Hence players are motivated to always click. It would be a loss not to!

We now have a pop-up they actively chose to view (not forced) and ensures friendly discoverability of ad options.

The other 70% of the time we offer the option to watch an ad for a huge reward (worth tens of minutes of game time).

This feels less of an aggressive attack as they are free to dismiss the ad and the return on clicking to open the pop-up significantly outweighs the cost: 30% chance to benefit greatly vs 70% chance to dismiss a message.

We randomise reward values and hope the high reward is too good to pass up.

Players anticipate high-value outcomes during the time's they are lowballed, eagerly awaiting the next present rather than settle for the current offer. It could likely be sitting in the back of their mind during gameplay.

This mix of chance and choice drives engagement while naturally supporting monetisation.
